# StudentResult-Class

This project demonstrates the implementation of a `StudentResult` class that tracks a student's exam results, including their grades, average grade, and status (whether they passed all exams or not). The class allows adding grades, calculating the average, and determining the student's status. The project also includes pytest test cases to validate the methods of the class.

## Features

- **Add Grades**: Allows adding grades for multiple exams.
- **Calculate Average**: Calculates the average grade of the student across all exams.
- **Determine Status**: Determines if the student has passed all exams (assuming passing grade is 6 or higher).
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs (negative grades or grades greater than 10).
